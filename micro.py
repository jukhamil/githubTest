#I consider today a major breakthrough. I learned how to write to files with bash, and I learned that coding can be an evening mindless activity - just use the python command line and help function - and in the future every task can be made evening mindless, just make it into a teeny coding command line interface or something that keeps you glued. OK!
#Ok now I will make my python tool.
